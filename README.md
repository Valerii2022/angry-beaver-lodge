# The Angry Beaver Lodge, Oakes (North Dakota USA)

The **Angry Beaver Lodge** has been the cornerstone of Oakes Main Street for
over 20 years. The unusual name stems from owner Shawn Ulmer’s three sons’
favorite cartoon and reflects the relaxed, fun atmosphere inside. But one thing
we’re serious about around here is the food. Whether you’re having a juicy steak
grilled to perfection, our award-winning ribs, or our signature double double
burger- there’s no doubt you’re going to be glad you had dinner with us tonight!
